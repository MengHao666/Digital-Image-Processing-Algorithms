# Digital-Image-Processing-Algorithms
# Various image processing algorithms using pure python3.7,opencv4,numpy or qt: 
  1.A Image processing GUI;  
  
  2.FFT&amp;IFFT implenting with python;  
  
  3.Exponential transformation,Histogram_equalization,Median filtering,Laplace image sharpening ;   
  
  4.Edge detection using Roberts、Sobel、Prewitt、Laplace ; Reconstructions using FFT descriptors ;   
  
  5.RGB color clustering using k-means.  
  

# All algorithms have been tested on python3.7 on Ubuntu16.04.

# TW,This is the homework for "Digital image processing" in BUAA, 2019.

# Hope it could help some people,and welcome for any corrections or improvements.

# Some methods here are copied or inspired by some open source codes! Thanks to them!
