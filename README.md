# Digital-Image-Processing-Algorithms  

**Some image processing algorithms using python3.7,opencv4,numpy or qt:**
  * 1.A Image processing GUI;  
  
  * 2.FFT&amp;IFFT;  
  
  * 3.Exponential transformation,Histogram equalization,Median filtering, Image sharpening using Laplace operator;   
  
  * 4.Edge detection using Roberts,Sobel,Prewitt and Laplace operator; 
  
  * 5.Reconstructions using FFT descriptors ;   
  
  * 6.Color clustering of RGB images using K-means.  
  

**All algorithms have been tested on python3.7 on Ubuntu16.04.**

**BTW,this is the homework for graduate course "Digital Image Processing" in Beihang University, 2020.**

**Hope it could help ,and welcome for any corrections or improvements.**

**Some codes here are copied or inspired by some open source codes! Thanks to them!**
